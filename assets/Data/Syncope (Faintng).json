  "Differntail Diagnosis": {
    "name": [
      "1.Vasovagal syncope:",
      "This is the commonest cause of fainting It is more likely to occur in young tense, anxious patients particularly in females under the effect of strong emotion, in hot crowded places, on the sight of blood, by severe pain and venipuncture. It almost always occurs when a person is standing and is relieved by lying down. Fainting is preceded by pallor, nausea, cold sweating, yawning and weakness. Sometimes clenching of teeth, the rigidity of muscles and clonic movements may occur. Unconsciousness lasts for only a few seconds or minutes and the patient quickly recovers colour if laid down.",
      "2.Postural hypotension:",
      "The onset of fainting is sudden and almost always the attacks occur on standing from a sitting or lying posture. The patient may have a history of blood or fluid loss or may have symptoms of autonomic neuropathy due to some disease (Diabetes mellitus) or maybe using drugs which may cause hypotension (Anti-hypertensive, anti-psychotic and antiparkinsonian drugs) or the cause may be unknown (Primary orthostatic hypotension). Recovery from an attack is usually rapid.",
