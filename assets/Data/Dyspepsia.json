      "1.Non Ulcer or functional dyspepsia:",
      "The patient is often a tense, unmarried or separated individual who complains of vague upper abdominal discomfort, flatulence or pain. Pain when present is often described with sweeping movement of one or both hands. Pain cannot be relieved by simple measures, is unconvincing or changing from time to time and although it occurs before break-fast, it does not disturb sleep. Belching, burping and morning nausea may be prominent. When vomiting occurs patient cannot eat for several hours afterwards. Symptoms are continuous oc√ßurring daily over long periods of time. Associated symptoms of anxiety or depression may be present and there may be history of previous psychiatric disturbances. ",
      "2.Peptic ulcer:",
      "The patient may be a young (Duodenal ulcer) or middle-aged individual (Gastric ulcer) complaining of cutting, or burning pain in the epigastrium or left hypochondrium (gastric ulcer) or right hypochondrium (duodenal ulcer) which is brought on (gastric ulcer) or relieved by food (Duodenal Ulcer) although this association may not be present. Patients with duodenal ulcers may wake up early in the morning due to pain. Pain is often relieved by antacids or vomiting and worsened by spicy food, steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and retrosternal burning water brash. Haematemesis or melaena may Occur. Symptoms often occur in episodes lasting 7 to 14 days or longer two to six times a year with long remissions. There may be a family history of similar symptoms. Change in the pattern of symptoms with no relief by food, antacids, or continuous symptoms with associated symptoms of anorexia, pallor and weight loss in a patient with a known gastric ulcer is very suspicious of change to gastric carcinoma. ",
      "3.Chronic cholecystitis:",
      "The patient is often but not always a fat, fertile female past her forty complaining of flatulence with or without biliary colic. Biliary colic presents as pain in the right hypochondrium or epigastrium which may radiate to the right shoulder or scapula. Pain is very severe, coming in attacks lasting for minutes to hours and associated with vomiting, shivering and sweating and relieved by strong analgesics only. There may be history of jaundice,, clay colour ed stools and dark urine after Such an attack. These symptoms are often worsened by fatty or fried meals."
